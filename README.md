# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using machine learning techniques to group customers based on their behavior and attributes. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer types, personalize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and increase overall revenue.

The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering algorithms to identify meaningful customer groups. By analyzing patterns in customer data such as spending behavior and demographics, we can uncover hidden insights that support data-driven decision-making.
